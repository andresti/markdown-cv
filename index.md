## Introduction

For many years, I worked on the front lines of science as a particle physicist at the CMS experiment at CERN,
analyzing data collected from particle collisions to measure Nature's most fundamental processes.
I've presented my (and other people's) work in international conferences and received prizes for my posters.

At various other times I've also studied computer science and worked on practical business problems as a software developer and machine learning engineer.
The unique skill set obtained through these experiences has given me a good background to solve various quantitative problems.

Nowadays, I'm mostly interested in applying my skills to difficult problems to solve important practical challenges in the world.
As a technical lead and CTO at Soulie, I've been working for a better internet with less distractions and more freedom of choice.
Even though I've always considered myself an thoroughly technical person, the recent time as CTO has shown that I'm also somewhat capable of leading and managing if needed.

<!-- Always up for new intellectually stimulating problems to improve the world in some way. -->
