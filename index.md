## Introduction

For recent years I've been around the world, working as a particle Physicist at the CMS experiment at CERN, analyzing data collected from particle collisions to measure Nature's most fundamental processes. It's just like data science, but for physicists. I've presented my (and other people's) work in international conferences and received prizes for my posters.

Now I'm looking to apply my skills in a place where practical results of my work could be seen in my lifetime or even sooner :)
In any case, I'd like that somewhere to be intellectually stimulating and making the world a better place in some way.

## Skills

* Programming and software development (Python, Bash, git, SQL, C/C++, Java)
* Data analysis (Scikit-learn, Pandas, XGBoost, ROOT)
* Research
* Problem solving
* Presenting (Latex, HTML, talks, posters)

### Languages

* Estonian - native
* English - fluent
* Finnish - passive
* Italian, French - beginner
